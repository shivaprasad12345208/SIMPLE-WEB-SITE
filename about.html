<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Virat Kohli was born on 5 November 1988 in Delhi into a Punjabi Hindu family. His father, Prem Nath Kohli, worked as a criminal lawyer, and his mother, Saroj Kohli, served as a housewife. He has an older brother, Vikas, and an older sister, Bhawna.[10] Kohli's formative years were spent in Uttam Nagar. He commenced his early education at Vishal Bharti Public School.[11] According to his family, Kohli exhibited an early affinity for cricket as a three-year-old. He would pick up a cricket bat and request his father bowl to him.</p>

<p>Kohli's playing style is aggressive, a trait that extends to his leadership on the field.[57][58] His captaincy is characterized as proactive, taking decisions and leading the team by example.[59] Kohli has been the subject of much media scrutiny and criticism in the early stages of his career. He was often portrayed as a brash and arrogant individual, eliciting mixed reactions.[60][61] While some have praised his assertiveness and confidence,[62][63] others have criticized Kohli's behaviour for crossing the boundaries of fair play and for losing control, sometimes resulting in a loss of composure.[64] Despite his efforts to curb his aggressive behaviour, Kohli has acknowledged that there are times when intense pressure or high-stakes situations may challenge his resolve.</p>

<p>Kohli's foundation has organized several charity events to raise funds for its causes, including football matches featuring Indian cricketers and Bollywood actors. The first such event was a celebrity football match in collaboration with Abhishek Bachchan's charity foundation, which drew media attention and was raised funds.[122] In this match, Kohli captained the All Hearts FC against the All Stars FC, led by Abhishek Bachchan.[123] Another charity football match, dubbed the "Celebrity Clasico", was held in June 2016 in Mumbai, with Kohli again leading the All Hearts FC against the All Stars FC, captained by Ranbir Kapoor.</p>
